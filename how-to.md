# Project Template

This is a Template. On GitHub, click **Use this template** at the top right to create your own project based on this one.

This template repo is meant to provide a basic structure to help organize code, data, and reports related to a particular project for the ACF Data Surge Team.

This repo is set up to run as an app in a docker containter, although not required. It is currently set to `python` but you can change the language and the launch script.

## Project Checklist

Below is a checklist of items to work on for a project. This is to help you reference, stay organized and on top of the work. There's some upfront lift needed to scope and set up the project but the intent is that it flows smoothly and predictable for you afterwards.

Copy this checklist to a suitable location for your use. You can also edit the markdown file to check the individual boxes.

## Coding Standards

Reference the [ACF Data Surge Team coding standards](https://github.com/HHS/acf-datasurge-standards/tree/feat/standards-version-1) for further details on coding practices.

## Requirements

To ensure app dependencies are ported from your virtual environment/host machine into your container, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
```

Then run:

```bash
pipreqs --ignore .venv --scan-notebooks --force
```

If you encounter issues with connecting to pypi, you can change the server by adding the following: `--pypi-server <url>`

## Docker

I like running things in linux. Docker makes it standardized through configuration files like `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Dockerfile`.

You can delete the docker files along with the .vscode folder containing launch.json and tasks.json if they're not needed for the project.

### VSCode extension

Use the dockerextension to make it easy to change the programming language. Currently set as default for `python:3.12-slim`.

To change language version you can call the command pallete `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and select: `Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...`

### .dockerignore

This will ignore files and folders when building the container image.

### docker-compose

Use the following command to build and execute the docker container:

```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```

### Dockerfile

Contains all the necesary information to build a docker image with the application inside.
